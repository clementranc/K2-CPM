Program cpm\_part2.py reads 5 different types of files:

* ?-pre\_matrix\_xy.dat - generated by not yet exisiting cpm\_part1.py
* ?-predictor\_epoch\_mask.dat - constructed by multipletpf.py
* ?-pixel\_flux.dat - constructed by tpfdata.py
* ?-mask.dat - constructed by tpfdata.py
* ?-epoch\_mask.dat - constructed by tpfdata.py

Note that the code is treated as a module so that it can be tested. Hence, you should add the directory to your PYTOHPATH before running it. Alternative approach is to search for all 'from code import' and modify them.
