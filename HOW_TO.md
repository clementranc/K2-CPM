Program cpm\_part2.py reads 4 different types of files:

* ?-pre\_matrix\_xy.dat - generated by not yet exisiting cpm\_part1.py
* ?-predictor\_epoch\_mask.dat - constructed by multipletpf.py
* ?-pixel\_flux.dat - constructed by tpfdata.py
* ?-epoch\_mask.dat - constructed by tpfdata.py

Note that the code is treated as a module so that it can be tested. Hence, you should add the directory to your PYTOHPATH before running it. Alternative approach is to search for all 'from code import' and modify them.

There are unit test files: source/K2CPM/tests/test\_\*.py. Unit tests can be executed e.g. by running py.test from source/K2CPM/tests/.

File tpfdata.py (and hence multipletpf.py) requires the directory with tpf files. Currently it is set to tpf/ in every script.
